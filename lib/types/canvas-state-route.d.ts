/**
 * Same-origin HTTP route receiving live canvas-state pushes from the

 * (origin, method, body size, field shapes, embedded image bytes) before it
 * reaches the mirror. Selection screenshots stay in memory: the mirror holds
 * the decoded bytes and a tool persists them only when the model actually
 * consumes them (view_canvas), so dead screenshots never hit the disk.
