/**
 * Live canvas-state sync from one tldraw surface to the host mirror.
 *
 * The conversation agent runs in the host process and cannot see the browser
 * canvas, so this module is the canvas's voice: it watches the editor store,
 * summarizes the page (shape inventory + selection) and pushes a compact
 * snapshot to the canvas-state route. When the selection settles, it also
 * exports a fallback PNG screenshot (persistent images may come from a
 * different conversation), which the host
 * turns into a durable attachment (view_canvas / edit_image
 * source=canvas_selection read exactly that).
 *
 * Pushes are fire-and-forget: failures warn in the console and the next
 * change retries. Duplicate snapshots (e.g. camera pans that change nothing
 * in the summary) never hit the network.
